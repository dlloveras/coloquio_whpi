1- hello everyone, In this talk I'm going to tell you about this paper that has been publised a few months ago in the Jornal of geophisical research titled 3D structure of the corona during the whole heliosphere and planetary interval campaing rotation 2219 and 2223.
2- Que hicimos?

Each of those intensity values is the result of a line-of-sight (LOS) integral of an unknown coronal quantity times a known weighting factor which depends on the geometry of the observation and the emission mechanism.

6- streamer es dominante la banda 193 con temperatura caracteristica 1.5MK y en CH la emisivdad dominantes es la de 171 con temperaturas caracteristicas del orden de 1MK. Y las distribuciones termicas asociadas.

This ratio WT/Te represents the characteristic variability of the electron temperature in a voxel. 

A similar degree of relative variability is expected to characterize the distribution of electron density within each voxel, whose scale height along magnetic field lines is proportional to the electron temperature

The model use adapt-gong magnetograms as boundary condition and addresses the coronal heating through the injection of energy by dissipation of Alfven waves. The model is subject to continuous validation with observations as it is updated and improved. And we are going to compare tomographic reconstructions with steady-state runs.

8-A very usefull validation test

Comparison of synthetic images derived from models against actual data is an important validation test

In order to characterize the global thermodynamic state of the solar corona along different magnetic structures, the tomographic and simulation results are traced along magnetic field lines. Each field lines is classified as open or closed according to their full geometry. Closed magnetic field line were separated in two segments that goes from the coronal base up to the apex. For each segment a fits are applied in order to characterize the traced results in a simple way.

In the case of DEMT, a hydrostatic isotermic fit is applied to the electron density as a function of height, and a linear fit is applied to the electron temperature as a function of height

Here I'm showing you the location of each selected leg, divided in four colours.
Here each dot represents a magnetic line.

We can see that type 0 populate mostly the equator.

This figures shows the average fits to Ne and Te. and reveal in 3D detail the density and temperature structure. When moving from the core region of the streamer to the outer layers, the electron density at the coronal base decreases (and the scale height increases).
The electron temperature increases when moving from the streamer core to its outer layers, and then decreases when moving out to the open regions. These trends are observed for both DEMT and AWSoM.

12- Error bars of the DEMT products due to their dominating sources (radiometric calibration and tomographic regularization)

13- Figure shows latitude-longitude maps of the electron density Ne of both the C2-SRT analysis and the AWSoM model. Maps are shown at a sample heliocentric height r = 2.5 R âŠ™ , the lowest height of the LASCO-C2 radial FoV.

Again we compared the real data with synthetic images

shows a doubled peaked streamer

14- 
In the case of C2-SRT, the radial FoV covered by the instrument makes the hydrostatic regime less adequate to fit the electron density. That is why we used a simple PL that has an optimal goodness-of-fit to Ne results.

15- We investigate the correlation between the terminal wind speed of the AWSoM model and the electron density and temperature of the low corona given by DEMT. To that end, we traced open field lines from the coronal base up to 20Rsun, where the model essentially reached its terminal properties.

The vertical spread of the data points around the observed trends is consistent with the characteristic LDEM temperature spread WT within each voxel. Note also that slower terminal speeds tend to be found along field lines that terminate at lower latitudes, near the heliospheric current sheet (HCS).
